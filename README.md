# Brian Lam
From finance to code! I'm a UCI graduate with a background in business economics. Worked as an accountant at a top 50 accounting firm before pursuing my passion for software development, and I'm now a front end developer at a credit union. Outside of work, I'm a gamer 👾, Netflix binger 😵‍💫, and fitness enthusiast 💪.
